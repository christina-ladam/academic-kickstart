Welcome! I am an Assistant Professor of political science at the University of Nevada, Reno. Before joining the faculty at the University of Nevada, Reno, I received my MPA from the University of New Hampshire and my Ph.D. from the University of Colorado.

I specialize in American political behavior and political methodology. My current work uses an experimental approach to understand ways in which formal deliberative events can be structured to promote beneficial outcomes from deliberation. Other research interests include interpersonal political discussion, women and politics, state and local politics, network analysis and experiments.
